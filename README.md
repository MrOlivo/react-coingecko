# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/react-coingecko/](http://localhost:5173/react-coingecko/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `pnpm run preview`

Locally preview the production build. Do not use this as a production server as it's not designed for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
